										<p>I'm a PhD candidate working under the supervision of Christian Reichardt at The University of Melbourne.
											<br>I completed my BSc in Physics at the University of Melbourne in 2018 before taking a year off to travel the Americas where I spent just over a month at Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory in La Serena, Chile.
											<br>
											After returning home I went on to obtain my MSc also from the University of Melbourne in 2020, and begin my PhD the following year.

										<div class="row">
											<p>
												Like most in the astro field, I absolutely love to travel, especially when it's for a conference in a warm part of the world!
												<br>
												I think it's incredibly important to visit all parts of the world and experience all kinds of cultures, and I'm very privelaged to be
												part of a community that puts focus on this (and builds experiments in some pretty unique places).
											</p>
											</div>
										<h4 class="major">Film & TV</h4>
											<div class="row">
												<p>
													This might seem pretty generic to say that I love watching movies and TV but my passions here delve a little deeper.
													<br>
													I actually studied quite a bit of film making in my high school and undergraduate degree. I also have some family heavily involved in the industry.
													<br>
													Oh, and I worked at a cinema for 10 years! Working my way from sweeping popcorn off seats to management. 
													<br>
													Safe to say, if I wasn't so passionate for science, I'd probably be in quite a different field...

												</p>
												</div>
										<h4 class="major"> Sports, Hiking & Camping</h4>
												<div class="row">
													<p>
														Most nights of the week that I'm not still in the office or binging a new series, I'm probably playing sport.
														<br>
														I've always loved sports and throughout the years I've certainly tried as many as I could.
														Tennis, futsal, basketball, volleyball (and rebound beach volleyball) and netball to name the few I put the most time into. 
														Lately I've pulled myself back to just volleyball and netball (with the odd week rebound beach volleyball - if you haven't tried it,
														do yourself a favour and check it out).
														<br>
														<br>
														Most weekends that aren't already booked out, my partner and I are looking for somewhere new to go for an adventure. 
														We are avid hikers and have no shortage of great, off the beaten track, places to explore. 
														<br>
														Coming from farming families, we're no strangers to 'bush bashing' as we'd say and camping out under the stars.
