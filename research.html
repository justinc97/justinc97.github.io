									<h4 class="major">[foreword] The Simons Observatory</h4>

									Before delving into some of the science I love and work on I'll prefice that nearly all of my work has been as a member of the Simons Observatory (SO).
									<br>
									This incredible experiment is a set of next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) telescopes. 
									The two key components of this experiment are the small aperture telescopes (3 SATs - already observing now!) and our big beast, the 6m mirror large aperture telescope (LAT - due to start observing early 2025).
									<br>
									The Simons Observatory is set to cover a vast number of science goals, including what I discuss below.
									<br>
									For more information please check out the SO website <a href="https://simonsobservatory.org/">here</a>.
									<br><br><br>
									<h4 class="major">I. The millimeter-transient sky</h4>
									The astrophysical sky is an explosive one (pun intended). A field of astrophysics that continues to surprise and leave us wanting to know more.
									<br>
									There is an incredibly diverse set of experiments dedicated to observing transients across the electromagnetic spectrum, at various sensitivity and observational scales.
									<br>
									Interestingly, the millimeter space has been pretty quiet from the observational front. 
									Particularly interesting when we consider that synchrotron radiation, which dominates at these frequencies, is a pivotal component of understanding transient emission mechanisms.
									<br>
									Whilst we do have the capability to make observations at these wavelengths, we don't on large sky scales to make statistical studies or build up large datasets. 
									This is where the Simons Observatory, and my work, come into play.
									But wait, what's that? A CMB experiment observing transients? Yup you heard correct.
									<br>
									Measuring and modelling synchrotron radiation with CMB experiments has always been important given its signal peaking in our typical bands.
									If we can clearly and consistently see synchrotron emission across the sky, why not keep track of where it's coming from a bit more.
									Not to mention the fact these types of experiments cover HUGE sky areas, SO for example observing 40% of the sky and with high cadence.
									<br>
									So, we see the right radiation, we see a large patch of sky, AND we can scan back and forth over the same parts of the sky quickly? Sounds like the perfect transient experiment.
									<br>
									That's exactly what we're aiming for. Using the benefits of SO's sky area, frequency range and cadence, I am developing a pipeline to blindly detect astrophysical
									transients in the time ordered data as it is processed by the large aperture telescope. 
									What's extra unique here is using the time ordered data directly. Whilst maps allow us to more easily spot blinking lights on the sky, they limit how fast those flashes can be, at the best cadence, maps still average down data to the smallest gap of about 5 minutes.
									Anything quicker than this? Well that's going to melt into noise.
									<br>
									The bulk of my PhD has been spent understanding the time ordered data from CMB experiments and figuring out what it will take to find these objects, long story short, it's a lot!

									<br><br>
									<h4 class="major">II. Polarized Galactic Cold Clumps</h4>
									<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.3712C/abstract" class="special">NASA ADS</a>
									Stellar evolution is a long and extensively studied field with many holes still remaining. How do we get from some gas particles to a giant burning ball of light? Well one stage of this involves proto-stellar clumps.
									These are cold dense clumps of gas that we've observed throughout the Milky Way as but one stage in the evolutionary cycle of stars.
									<br>
									Utilising the Planck satellite we performed a stacking analysis of these Galactic cold clumps. 
									We were able to measure, for the first time, the mean-squared and RMS polarization fraction of Galactic cold clumps. Tests were also performed on the relationship between this polarization contribution across the Galactic dust to cold clump properties such a their flux density, luminosity and Galactic distribution where we found no strong evidence of these affecting the polarization and hence likely the magnetic fields of these objects. We also performed a forecast for observing Galactic cold clumps in intensity and polarization with the Simons Observatory.


									<br><br>
									<h4 class="major">III. Relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich</h4>
									Seeing as I'm spending so much time working with a CMB experiment, I would make sense for me to have some involvement with a research topic more typically aligned with the CMB right?
									<br>
									Recently I have been involved in a joint research project between the Univeristy of Melbourne, the Univeristy of Manchester and the University of Toronto based around expanding future research on the Sunyave-Zedovich effect.
									In partiular, what next-generation experiments could offer into broadening our understanding of this effect.
									<br>
									My particular involvement is exploring the impacts of what the relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect will have on generating our galaxy cluster catalogues in comparison to traditional theories. Is this something we should be taking into account? Or is it sub-dominant to other factors we already tackle? We shall see...

									<br><br>
									<h4 class="major">Oh there's some code too?</h4>
									Below are some links to my Github repositories for previous works. In particular, with the cold clump study we developed a mask generator from the 
									Planck catalogues.
									Taking a dive a bit further back in my studies, I also have some functions for beam calibration utilising point sources, a project I completed throughout my Masters.
